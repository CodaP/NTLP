isfc = 0, 0, 0  ! isfc = 0 sets surface flux (qstar), isfc = 1 sets surface condition (Dirichlet through tsfcc)
iDNS         = 0! DNS or LES (subgrid computation or molecular visc and diffusivity)
ispray       = 1! particles?
icouple      = 0! particle momentum coupling
iTcouple     = 0! particle thermal coupling
iHcouple     = 0! iHcouple also controls TE couple (humidity coupling??)

istbl        = 0! istbl =0 for neutral, istbl = 1 for unstable/stable
isfs         = 0! isfs = 1 for Weil et al. Lagrangian stochastic model, isfs = 0 for stochastic xp based on vis_s
iUprod       = 1! iUprod =1 for uniform particle generation, = 0 for heterogeneous generation (not working atm)
ipolydisp    = 0! ipolydisp=1 enables polydisperse particles, otherwise sets to radius_max
ishift       = 0! ishift=1 enables shift in wind-speed & heat flux after some time
ifields      = 0! if set to 1, reads the initial condition from path_ran below; otherwise calls subroutine random
iPprod       = 0! if set to 1, will be an inital point source (Thomas's project)
iSSGF        = 0! 0=Monahans, 1=Smith, 2= etc.. (Only works for polydispersity == 1)
inonperiodic = 0! 0=particles bouncing from surface, 1 for death at surface
